        <h2>What is Newfiles?</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is a command-line tool to help build new projects from existing templates, instead of from scratch. It can be used on either Windows or Mac.</p> 
        <p>You can create templates for virtually any type of project. Newfiles is completely platform agnostic; it's not geared towards any one type of code Nor any one type of platform. You are only limited by your imagination, when it comes to creating templates.</p> 
        <p>Newfiles will generate your new project based on the rules you defined in your reusable template, such as...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What files and folders get created?</li>
            <li>What are their file/folder names?</li>
            <li>What file/folder names are always the same? Which names are variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which text content is variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which casing (uppercase, lowercase, normalcase, or capitalized) format should variable text content have in different spots?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Define these rules using simple-to-grasp, platform-agnostic token-based <token>markup</token>, inside your template files: Newfiles follows your template's instructions so you retain full ownership and control over what gets put into your project files.</p>
        <p>Do you have a working project that contains reusable content? Turn it into a template.</p>
        <p>Auto-generate your boilterplate project. Reduce your setup time. Start working on core-functionality sooner.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    	<h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Click <a target="_blank" href="#">download and install Newfiles instructions</a>, if you don't already have it working on your computer.</p>
        <p>How do you know if Newfiles is already installed? Start your command prompt (Windows) or shell (Mac) and type the command, <cmd>nf</cmd>. If you see a list of "nf" commands, then you know Newfiles is already installed and working.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    	<h2>My First Template</h2>
        <h3>What is the templates folder?</h3>
		<p>During installation, you defined your Newfiles templates folder. <u>This is where all templates are stored</u>. Let's create a new template in that folder.</p> 
        <p>If you don't remember where the templates folder is located, just type the command, <cmd>nf templates</cmd> to open it:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="3" src="img/1_1.gif" alt="Open the templates folder" />
        <p>Try it yourself. Can you run the <cmd>nf templates</cmd> command?</p>
        <h3>Create the template</h3>
        <p>This will be the most simple template ever and utterly useless, but it will be a good way to start wrapping your head around Newfiles.</p>
		<p>Inside the templates folder</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Create a sub-folder called "MyFirstTemplate"</li>
            <li>Create a file, inside "MyFirstTemplate", called "afile.txt"</li>
            <li>Inside "afile.txt", write some content: "My favorite color is blue"</li>
        </ul>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue
        </code>
        <p>Tah dah. You have created your first template. It's that easy.</p>
        <p>Now, you will create a project based on this simple template. Where do you want to create this project? In your command-line console, change your current directory to where you want to create your project. You can put your project anywhere, but I will create a new directory called "myprojects" to use as an example:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="4" src="img/2_1.gif" alt="Example: Create a projects directory" />
        <p>Now, type the command, <cmd>nf ls</cmd> to make sure that Newfiles can see your new template in the console. "MyFirstTemplate" should be listed.</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/3_1.gif" alt="See a list of templates" />
        <p>Note the index number to the left of "MyFirstTemplate". This template index allows you to select your template. Your index may be different if your template library includes different templates.</p>
        <h3>Build a Project</h3>
        <p>Now, you will build a new project based on your "MyFirstTemplate" template</p>
        <p>The command to use a template, to build a new project, is <cmd>nf use {template-index}</cmd>. In this example, the "MyFirstTemplate" template's index is 0 so I'll type <cmd>use 0</cmd> to use <em>this</em> template:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="2" src="img/4_1.gif" alt="Build your first project" />
        <p>Great. What just happened? A new project, based on our mind-numbingly simple template, was created:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/5_1.gif" alt="What was created?" />
        <p>So what? For this example, it would have been easier to create this file by hand. True. This example was over-simplified to introduce you to some basic Newfiles commands. However, Newfiles becomes useful for more complicated templates, especially when it takes advantage of using <strong><em>tokens</em></strong>. You will learn about <strong>tokens</strong> in the next section.

    	<h2>My First Token</h2>
        <h3>What is a token?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>token</strong> is a placeholder. For example, if you've ever had to fill out a legal form, you may have had to sign your name on a <em>"dotted" line</em>. In this example, the blank line is a <em>placeholder</em> for your name.</p> 
        <p>Tokens are similar to <em>blank lines</em> in a legal document: Much of a template is "hard-coded", but you fill-in token values <em>on-the-fly</em> when you create your project.</p>
        <p>When you write a template, you can decide where to position tokens that represent <em>variable</em> content.</p>
        <h3>Write your first token</h3>
        <p>Now that you understand what a token is, how could you make "MyFirstTemplate" better by including a token?</p>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue
        </code>
        <p>Right now, "MyFirstTemplate" isn't very useful; what if you need to create a new project that says "My favorite color is <u>red</u>", or "<u>green</u>" or "<u>lavender</u>"... etc?</p> 
        <p>Different projects may all share pieces that are the same, but they also have parts that are unique.</p>
        <p>We want our template to fill in the content that's always the same, (to save time) but we also want our template to let us fill in unique value(s) that vary in different projects. To accomplish this, let's write our first token:</p>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>
        </code>
        <p>Go ahead, add the token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> to "afile.txt".</p>
        <p>With our new token, let's see what happens now when we <cmd>nf use</cmd> "MyFirstTemplate":</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="6" src="img/6_1.gif" alt="Use a template with a token" />
        <p>What just happened? Here is a review of the commands we used:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><cmd>nf use 0</cmd>... <strong>0</strong> is our template index. We chose which template to use.</li>
            <li><cmd>1/1) Enter --&gt; "my favorite color" &gt;&gt; GREEN</cmd>... we chose what value to use for the <strong>"my favorite color"</strong> token. Remember, a token is just a placeholder for a value. Our token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> is a placeholder in the template. In this example, I entered the value, "<strong><em>GREEN</em></strong>".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Great. What does the project look like? Take a look at the new <strong>afile.txt</strong> file. We will see that our token has been replaced by our value:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/7_1.gif" alt="What was created" />
        <p>You may notice something strange... I entered uppercase "GREEN" into the command-line but in my project, the value is lowercase "green". Why?</p>
        <h3>Tokens can control casing</h3>
		<p>You can use tokens to determine the casing of input values. Look again at the token from the example: <token>var:l:my favorite color</token></p>
        <p>This token contains three parts that are separated by a <em>colon</em>, ':'. The second part may look like the number one, but it's actually a lowercase letter 'l'.</p>
        <p>This lowercase letter 'l' stands for <em>lowercase</em>. It will transform any input value into all lowercase letters. The <em>second token-part</em> will <u>always</u> control the letter casing of input values.</p>
        <p>So, if you used a different letter, it would modify the input casing a different way:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>l</strong>: all <u>lowercase</u> letters</li>
            <li><strong>u</strong>: all <u>UPPERCASE</u> letters</li>
            <li><strong>c</strong>: <u>Capitalize</u> the first letter... leave the other letters alone.</li>
            <li><strong>n</strong>: all letters will be left alone (<u>normal-casing</u>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The parts of a token</h3>
        <p>Now you know that tokens are made up of different colon-separated "<em>parts</em>". Now you'll learn what those parts are:</p>
        <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>
        <ol>
        	<li><strong>Type</strong>: The first part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-type</em>. In this example, the type is "<em>var</em>", which stands for "<em>variable</em>".</li>
            <li><strong>Casing</strong>: The second part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-casing</em>. In this example, the casing is "<em>lowercase</em>".</li>
            <li><strong>Name</strong>: The last part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-name</em>. Note, this part is always <em>last</em>, but it's not always <em>third</em>. In this example, the name is "<em>my favorite color</em>".</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The token name is what you will see when you are asked to enter a value in the command line, eg: <cmd>1/1) Enter --&gt; "my favorite color" &gt;&gt; </cmd>.</p> 
        <h3>Using the same token name in different spots</h3>
        <p>If my template used the token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> multiple times, I would <em>STILL</em> only have to enter "my favorite color" <em>ONE</em> time in the command line; multiple tokens, with the same name, are the same token.</p>
        <p>To illustrate this, consider this template:</p>
        <code file="Example: 2-token template">My favorite color is <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>.
I SAID IT IS <token>var:u:my favorite color</token>!
        </code>
        <p>Now let's say I build a project with the following input:</p>
        <cmd>1/1) Enter --&gt; "my favorite color" &gt;&gt; rEd</cmd>
        <p>My resulting project file would look like this:</p>
        <code file="Example: 2-token project">My favorite color is red.
I SAID IT IS RED!</code>
        <p>Although I only had to enter "rEd" one time, my value replaced each token that had the "my favorite color" name. Also note, you are able to set <em>different casing</em> for the same value in <em>different spots</em>, ie: "red" and "RED".</p>
        <h3>Checkpoint -- What you learned:</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>What is a token and how is it useful inside a template?</li>
            <li>How do you use a token when building a project?</li>
            <li>How can you review what tokens are present, inside a template, when you are building a project in the command line?</li>
            <li>How will Newfiles handle building a project if one or more of the project files already exist?</li>
            <li>What are the different parts of a token?</li>
            <li>How do you control casing for input values?</li>
        </ul>

    	<h2>More "var" token-type examples</h2>
        <h3>More than one token name</h3>
        <p>So far we've only seen a template that uses ONE token name, <em>"my favorite color"</em>. However, it's possible to create templates that have <em>many</em> different token names.</p>
        <p>For this example, I'll create a new template called "VarTokenExamples". It will contain one file called "examples.html":</p>
        <code file="templates/VarTokenExamples/examples.html">Hi <token>var:c:your name</token>,
        
        What's your favorite color?
        Oh, it's <token>var:l:favorite color</token>?
        That's a very <token>var:n:adjective</token> choice, <token>var:c:your name</token>!</code>
        <p>Try this example for yourself:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Open your command-line console.</li>
            <li>Open your templates folder with the shortcut command, <cmd>nf templates</cmd></li>
            <li>In the templates folder, create a new file-system folder called "VarTokenExamples"</li>
            <li>Now, in the command-line use <cmd>nf ls</cmd> to list your templates.
            	<ul><li>Notice that "VarTokenExamples" is NOT in the list... this is because "VarTokenExamples" does NOT yet contain <em>at least one file</em>.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>In order for "VarTokenExamples" to be considered a template, you must add at least one file directly under this folder. Go ahead and add the "examples.html" file. Once this file is under "VarTokenExamples", try the <cmd>nf ls</cmd> command again to see that your new template is now showing up in the list.</li>
            <li>Copy the example file content into "examples.html", if you haven't already.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you created the new "VarTokenExamples" template, let's use it to create a new project:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="5" src="img/8_1.gif" alt="Use a template with multiple tokens" />
        <p>Enter different token-values, if you wish then check to see what project content gets created.</p>
        <h3>Using a token "alias"</h3>
        <h3>More than one template file</h3>
