        <h2>What is Newfiles?</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is a command-line tool to help build new projects from existing templates, instead of from scratch. It can be used on either Windows or Mac.</p> 
        <p>You can create templates for virtually any type of project. Newfiles is completely platform agnostic; it's not geared towards any one type of code Nor any one type of platform. You are only limited by your imagination, when it comes to creating templates.</p> 
        <p>Newfiles will generate your new project based on the rules you defined in your reusable template, such as...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What files and folders get created?</li>
            <li>What are their file/folder names?</li>
            <li>What file/folder names are always the same? Which names are variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which text content is variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which casing (uppercase, lowercase, normalcase, or capitalized) format should variable text content have in different spots?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Define these rules using simple-to-grasp, platform-agnostic markup, inside your template files: Newfiles follows your template's instructions so you retain full ownership and control over what gets put into your project files.</p>
        <p>Do you have a working project that contains reusable content? Turn it into a template.</p>
        <p>Auto-generate your boilterplate project. Reduce your setup time. Start working on core-functionality sooner.</p>

    	<h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Click <a target="_blank" href="#">download and install Newfiles instructions</a>, if you don't already have it working on your computer.</p>
        <p>How do you know if Newfiles is already installed? Start your command prompt (Windows) or shell (Mac) and type the command, <cmd>nf</cmd>. If you see a list of "nf" commands, then you know Newfiles is already installed and working.</p>

    	<h2>My First Template</h2>
        <h3>The Templates Folder</h3>
		<p>During installation, you defined your Newfiles templates folder. <u>This is where all templates are stored</u>. Let's create a new template in that folder.</p> 
        <p>If you don't remember where the templates folder is located, just type the command, <cmd>nf templates</cmd> to open it:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="3" src="img/1_1.gif" alt="Open the templates folder" />
        <p>Try it yourself. Can you run the <cmd>nf templates</cmd> command?</p>
        <h3>Create the template</h3>
        <p>This will be the most simple template ever and utterly useless, but it will be a good way to start wrapping your head around Newfiles.</p>
		<p>Inside the templates folder</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Create a sub-folder called "MyFirstTemplate"</li>
            <li>Create a file, inside "MyFirstTemplate", called "afile.txt"</li>
            <li>Inside "afile.txt", write some content: "My favorite color is blue"</li>
        </ul>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue</code>
        <p>Tah dah. You have created your first template. It's that easy.</p>
        <p>Now, you will create a project based on this simple template. Where do you want to create this project? In your command-line console, change your current directory to where you want to create your project. You can put your project anywhere, but I will create a new directory called "myprojects" to use as an example:</p>
        <img slide="" src="img/console1.gif" alt="example: create a projects directory" />
        <p>Now, type the command, <cmd>nf ls</cmd> to make sure that Newfiles can see your new template in the console. "MyFirstTemplate" should be listed.</p>
        <img slide="" src="img/console2.gif" alt="see a list of templates" />
