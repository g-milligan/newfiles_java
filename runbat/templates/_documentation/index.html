        <h2>What is Newfiles?</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is a command-line tool to help build new projects from existing templates, instead of from scratch. It can be used on either Windows or Mac.</p> 
        <p>You can create templates for virtually any type of project. Newfiles is completely platform agnostic; it's not geared towards any one type of code Nor any one type of platform. You are only limited by your imagination, when it comes to creating templates.</p> 
        <p>Newfiles will generate your new project based on the rules you defined in your reusable template, such as...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What files and folders get created?</li>
            <li>What are their file/folder names?</li>
            <li>What file/folder names are always the same? Which names are variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which text content is variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which casing (uppercase, lowercase, normalcase, or capitalized) format should variable text content have in different spots?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Define these rules using simple-to-grasp, platform-agnostic markup, inside your template files: Newfiles follows your template's instructions so you retain full ownership and control over what gets put into your project files.</p>
        <p>Do you have a working project that contains reusable content? Turn it into a template.</p>
        <p>Auto-generate your boilterplate project. Reduce your setup time. Start working on core-functionality sooner.</p>

    	<h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Click <a target="_blank" href="#">download and install Newfiles instructions</a>, if you don't already have it working on your computer.</p>
        <p>How do you know if Newfiles is already installed? Start your command prompt (Windows) or shell (Mac) and type the command, <cmd>nf</cmd>. If you see a list of "nf" commands, then you know Newfiles is already installed and working.</p>

    	<h2>My First Template</h2>
        <h3>What is the templates folder?</h3>
		<p>During installation, you defined your Newfiles templates folder. <u>This is where all templates are stored</u>. Let's create a new template in that folder.</p> 
        <p>If you don't remember where the templates folder is located, just type the command, <cmd>nf templates</cmd> to open it:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="3" src="img/1_1.gif" alt="Open the templates folder" />
        <p>Try it yourself. Can you run the <cmd>nf templates</cmd> command?</p>
        <h3>Create the template</h3>
        <p>This will be the most simple template ever and utterly useless, but it will be a good way to start wrapping your head around Newfiles.</p>
		<p>Inside the templates folder</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Create a sub-folder called "MyFirstTemplate"</li>
            <li>Create a file, inside "MyFirstTemplate", called "afile.txt"</li>
            <li>Inside "afile.txt", write some content: "My favorite color is blue"</li>
        </ul>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue
        </code>
        <p>Tah dah. You have created your first template. It's that easy.</p>
        <p>Now, you will create a project based on this simple template. Where do you want to create this project? In your command-line console, change your current directory to where you want to create your project. You can put your project anywhere, but I will create a new directory called "myprojects" to use as an example:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="4" src="img/2_1.gif" alt="Example: Create a projects directory" />
        <p>Now, type the command, <cmd>nf ls</cmd> to make sure that Newfiles can see your new template in the console. "MyFirstTemplate" should be listed.</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/3_1.gif" alt="See a list of templates" />
        <p>Note the index number to the left of "MyFirstTemplate". This template index allows you to select your template. Your index may be different if your template library includes different templates.</p>
        <h3>Build a Project</h3>
        <p>Now, you will build a new project based on your "MyFirstTemplate" template</p>
        <p>The command to use a template, to build a new project, is <cmd>nf use {template-index}</cmd>. In this example, the "MyFirstTemplate" template's index is 0 so I'll type <cmd>use 0</cmd> to use <em>this</em> template:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="2" src="img/4_1.gif" alt="Build your first project" />
        <p>Great. What just happened? A new project, based on our mind-numbingly simple template, was created:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/5_1.gif" alt="What was created?" />
        <p>So what? For this example, it would have been easier to create this file by hand. True. This example was over-simplified to introduce you to some basic Newfiles commands. However, Newfiles becomes useful for more complicated templates, especially when it takes advantage of using <strong><em>tokens</em></strong>. You will learn about <strong>tokens</strong> in the next section.
        <h3>Recap -- What you learned:</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>What is the templates folder?</li>
            <li>What is a shortcut command to open the templates folder from the command line?</li>
            <li>How do you create a new template?</li>
            <li>What command will show you a list of your templates?</li>
            <li>What commands will use a template to build a new project?</li>
        </ul>

    	<h2>My First Token</h2>
        <h3>What is a token?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>token</strong> is a placeholder. For example, if you've ever had to fill out a legal form, you may have had to sign your name on a <em>"dotted" line</em>. In this example, the blank line is a <em>placeholder</em> for your name.</p> 
        <p>Tokens are similar to <em>blank lines</em> in a legal document: Much of a template is "hard-coded", but you fill-in token values <em>on-the-fly</em> when you create your project.</p>
        <p>When you write a template, you can decide where to position tokens that represent <em>variable</em> content.</p>
        <h3>Write your first token</h3>
        <p>Now that you understand what a token is, how could you make "MyFirstTemplate" better by including a token?</p>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue
        </code>
        <p>Right now, "MyFirstTemplate" isn't very useful; what if you need to create a new project that says "My favorite color is <u>red</u>", or "<u>green</u>" or "<u>lavender</u>"... etc?</p> 
        <p>Different projects may all share pieces that are the same, but they also have parts that are unique.</p>
        <p>We want our template to fill in the content that's always the same, (to save time) but we also want our template to let us fill in unique value(s) that vary in different projects. To accomplish this, let's write our first token:</p>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>
        </code>
        <p>Go ahead, add the token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> to "afile.txt".</p>
        <p>In this example, when we <cmd>nf use</cmd> "MyFirstTemplate", we decide what "my favorite color" will be. We don't have to worry about rewriting the hard-coded text again -- <em>"My favorite color is"</em> will always be the same in every project.</p>
        <p>Does your "afile.txt" contain the token? Let's see what happens now when we <cmd>use</cmd> "MyFirstTemplate":
