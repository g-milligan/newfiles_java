        <h2>What is Newfiles?</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is a command-line tool to help build new projects from existing templates, instead of from scratch. It can be used on either Windows or Mac.</p> 
        <p>You can create templates for virtually any type of project. Newfiles is completely platform agnostic; it's not geared towards any one type of code Nor any one type of platform. You are only limited by your imagination, when it comes to creating templates.</p> 
        <p>Newfiles will generate your new project based on the rules you defined in your reusable template, such as...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What files and folders get created?</li>
            <li>What are their file/folder names?</li>
            <li>What file/folder names are always the same? Which names are variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which text content is variable for each project?</li>
            <li>Which casing (uppercase, lowercase, normalcase, or capitalized) format should variable text content have in different spots?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Define these rules using simple-to-grasp, platform-agnostic token-based <token>markup</token>, inside your template files: Newfiles follows your template's instructions so you retain full ownership and control over what gets put into your project files.</p>
        <p>Do you have a working project that contains reusable content? Turn it into a template.</p>
        <p>Auto-generate your boilterplate project. Reduce your setup time. Start working on core-functionality sooner.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    	<h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Click <a target="_blank" href="#">download and install Newfiles instructions</a>, if you don't already have it working on your computer.</p>
        <p>How do you know if Newfiles is already installed? Start your command prompt (Windows) or shell (Mac) and type the command, <cmd>nf</cmd>. If you see a list of "nf" commands, then you know Newfiles is already installed and working.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    	<h2>My First Template</h2>
        <h3>What is the templates folder?</h3>
		<p>During installation, you defined your Newfiles templates folder. <u>This is where all templates are stored</u>. Let's create a new template in that folder.</p> 
        <p>If you don't remember where the templates folder is located, just type the command, <cmd>nf templates</cmd> to open it:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="3" src="img/1_1.gif" alt="Open the templates folder" />
        <p>Try it yourself. Can you run the <cmd>nf templates</cmd> command?</p>
        <h3>Create the template</h3>
        <p>This will be the most simple template ever and utterly useless, but it will be a good way to start wrapping your head around Newfiles.</p>
		<p>Inside the templates folder</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Create a sub-folder called "MyFirstTemplate"</li>
            <li>Create a file, inside "MyFirstTemplate", called "afile.txt"</li>
            <li>Inside "afile.txt", write some content: "My favorite color is blue"</li>
        </ul>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue
        </code>
        <p>Tah dah. You have created your first template. It's that easy.</p>
        <p>Now, you will create a project based on this simple template. Where do you want to create this project? In your command-line console, change your current directory to where you want to create your project. You can put your project anywhere, but I will create a new directory called "myprojects" to use as an example:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="4" src="img/2_1.gif" alt="Example: Create a projects directory" />
        <p>Now, type the command, <cmd>nf ls</cmd> to make sure that Newfiles can see your new template in the console. "MyFirstTemplate" should be listed.</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/3_1.gif" alt="See a list of templates" />
        <p>Note the index number to the left of "MyFirstTemplate". This template index allows you to select your template. Your index may be different if your template library includes different templates.</p>
        <h3>Build a Project</h3>
        <p>Now, you will build a new project based on your "MyFirstTemplate" template</p>
        <p>The command to use a template, to build a new project, is <cmd>nf use {template-index}</cmd>. In this example, the "MyFirstTemplate" template's index is 0 so I'll type <cmd>use 0</cmd> to use <em>this</em> template:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="2" src="img/4_1.gif" alt="Build your first project" />
        <p>Great. What just happened? A new project, based on our mind-numbingly simple template, was created:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/5_1.gif" alt="What was created?" />
        <p>So what? For this example, it would have been easier to create this file by hand. True. This example was over-simplified to introduce you to some basic Newfiles commands. However, Newfiles becomes useful for more complicated templates, especially when it takes advantage of using <strong><em>tokens</em></strong>. You will learn about <strong>tokens</strong> in the next section.

    	<h2>My First Token</h2>
        <h3>What is a token?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>token</strong> is a placeholder. For example, if you've ever had to fill out a legal form, you may have had to sign your name on a <em>"dotted" line</em>. In this example, the blank line is a <em>placeholder</em> for your name.</p> 
        <p>Tokens are similar to <em>blank lines</em> in a legal document: Much of a template is "hard-coded", but you fill-in token values <em>on-the-fly</em> when you create your project.</p>
        <p>When you write a template, you can decide where to position tokens that represent <em>variable</em> content.</p>
        <h3>Write your first token</h3>
        <p>Now that you understand what a token is, how could you make "MyFirstTemplate" better by including a token?</p>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is blue
        </code>
        <p>Right now, "MyFirstTemplate" isn't very useful; what if you need to create a new project that says "My favorite color is <u>red</u>", or "<u>green</u>" or "<u>lavender</u>"... etc?</p> 
        <p>Different projects may all share pieces that are the same, but they also have parts that are unique.</p>
        <p>We want our template to fill in the content that's always the same, (to save time) but we also want our template to let us fill in unique value(s) that vary in different projects. To accomplish this, let's write our first token:</p>
        <code file="templates/MyFirstTemplate/afile.txt">My favorite color is <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>
        </code>
        <p>Go ahead, add the token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> to "afile.txt".</p>
        <p>With our new token, let's see what happens now when we <cmd>nf use</cmd> "MyFirstTemplate":</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="6" src="img/6_1.gif" alt="Use a template with a token" />
        <p>What just happened? Here is a review of the commands we used:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><cmd>nf use 0</cmd>... <strong>0</strong> is our template index. We chose which template to use.</li>
            <li><cmd>1/1) Enter --&gt; "my favorite color" &gt;&gt; GREEN</cmd>... we chose what value to use for the <strong>"my favorite color"</strong> token. Remember, a token is just a placeholder for a value. Our token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> is a placeholder in the template. In this example, I entered the value, "<strong><em>GREEN</em></strong>".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Great. What does the project look like? Take a look at the new <strong>afile.txt</strong> file. We will see that our token has been replaced by our value:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/7_1.gif" alt="What was created" />
        <p>You may notice something strange... I entered uppercase "GREEN" into the command-line but in my project, the value is lowercase "green". Why?</p>
        <h3>Tokens can control casing</h3>
		<p>You can use tokens to determine the casing of input values. Look again at the token from the example: <token>var:l:my favorite color</token></p>
        <p>This token contains three parts that are separated by a <em>colon</em>, ':'. The second part may look like the number one, but it's actually a lowercase letter 'l'.</p>
        <p>This lowercase letter 'l' stands for <em>lowercase</em>. It will transform any input value into all lowercase letters. The <em>second token-part</em> will <u>always</u> control the letter casing of input values.</p>
        <p>So, if you used a different letter, it would modify the input casing a different way:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>l</strong>: all <u>lowercase</u> letters</li>
            <li><strong>u</strong>: all <u>UPPERCASE</u> letters</li>
            <li><strong>c</strong>: <u>Capitalize</u> the first letter... leave the other letters alone.</li>
            <li><strong>n</strong>: all letters will be left alone (<u>normal-casing</u>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The parts of a token</h3>
        <p>Now you know that tokens are made up of different colon-separated "<em>parts</em>". Now you'll learn what those parts are:</p>
        <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>
        <ol>
        	<li><strong>Type</strong>: The first part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-type</em>. In this example, the type is "<em>var</em>", which stands for "<em>variable</em>".</li>
            <li><strong>Casing</strong>: The second part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-casing</em>. In this example, the casing is "<em>lowercase</em>".</li>
            <li><strong>Name</strong>: The last part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-name</em>. Note, this part is always <em>last</em>, but it's not always <em>third</em>. In this example, the name is "<em>my favorite color</em>".</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The token name is what you will see when you are asked to enter a value in the command line, eg: <cmd>1/1) Enter --&gt; "my favorite color" &gt;&gt; </cmd>.</p> 
        <h3>Using the same token name in different spots</h3>
        <p>If my template used the token, <token>var:l:my favorite color</token> multiple times, I would <em>STILL</em> only have to enter "my favorite color" <em>ONE</em> time in the command line; multiple tokens, with the same name, are the same token.</p>
        <p>To illustrate this, consider this template:</p>
        <code file="Example: 2-token template">My favorite color is <token>var:l:my favorite color</token>.
I SAID IT IS <token>var:u:my favorite color</token>!
        </code>
        <p>Now let's say I build a project with the following input:</p>
        <cmd>1/1) Enter --&gt; "my favorite color" &gt;&gt; rEd</cmd>
        <p>My resulting project file would look like this:</p>
        <code file="Example: 2-token project">My favorite color is red.
I SAID IT IS RED!</code>
        <p>Although I only had to enter "rEd" one time, my value replaced each token that had the "my favorite color" name. Also note, you are able to set <em>different casing</em> for the same value in <em>different spots</em>, ie: "red" and "RED".</p>
        <h3>Checkpoint -- What you learned:</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>What is a token and how is it useful inside a template?</li>
            <li>How do you use a token when building a project?</li>
            <li>How can you review what tokens are present, inside a template, when you are building a project in the command line?</li>
            <li>How will Newfiles handle building a project if one or more of the project files already exist?</li>
            <li>What are the different parts of a token?</li>
            <li>How do you control casing for input values?</li>
        </ul>

    	<h2>More "var" token-type examples</h2>
        <h3>More than one token name</h3>
        <p>So far we've only seen a template that uses ONE token name, <em>"my favorite color"</em>. However, it's possible to create templates that have <em>many</em> different token names.</p>
        <p>For this example, I'll create a new template called "VarTokenExamples". It will contain one file called "examples.html":</p>
        <code file="templates/VarTokenExamples/examples.html">Hi <token>var:c:your name</token>,
        
        What's your favorite color?
        Oh, it's <token>var:l:favorite color</token>?
        That's a very <token>var:n:adjective</token> choice, <token>var:c:your name</token>!</code>
        <p>Try this example for yourself:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Open your command-line console.</li>
            <li>Open your templates folder with the shortcut command, <cmd>nf templates</cmd></li>
            <li>In the templates folder, create a new file-system folder called "VarTokenExamples"</li>
            <li>Now, in the command-line use <cmd>nf ls</cmd> to list your templates.
            	<ul><li>Notice that "VarTokenExamples" is NOT in the list... this is because "VarTokenExamples" does NOT yet contain <em>at least one file</em>.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>In order for "VarTokenExamples" to be considered a template, you must add at least one file directly under this folder. Go ahead and add the "examples.html" file. Once this file is under "VarTokenExamples", try the <cmd>nf ls</cmd> command again to see that your new template is now showing up in the list.</li>
            <li>Copy the example file content into "examples.html", if you haven't already.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you created the new "VarTokenExamples" template, let's use it to create a new project:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="5" src="img/8_1.gif" alt="Use a template with multiple tokens" />
        <p>Enter different token-values, if you wish then check to see what project content gets created.</p>
        <h3>Using token "aliases"</h3>
        <p>When you define a token once, is there a way to reuse the token without having to write the full syntax over-and-over again? Rewriting the full thing multiple times can get tedius and look cluttered. For example, my template uses <token>var:c:your name</token> in two spots... can I define type, casing, and name once, then reuse the repeated token definition multiple times?</p>
		<code file="repeated token, 'your name'">Hi <token>var:c:your name</token>,
        
        What's your favorite color?
        Oh, it's <token>var:l:favorite color</token>?
        That's a very <token>var:n:adjective</token> choice, <token>var:c:your name</token>!</code>
        <p>Also, what if I wanted to be able to change the casing for "your name" in the file? I would have to change it in both tokens. There has to be a more efficient way to write repeating tokens... there is; you can create a <em>token <strong>alias</strong></em>, which would look like this:</p>
		<code file="Using a token alias"><token>var:c:your name =&gt; [Name]</token>

        Hi <alias>[Name]</alias>,
        
        What's your favorite color?
        Oh, it's <token>var:l:favorite color</token>?
        That's a very <token>var:n:adjective</token> choice, <alias>[Name]</alias>!</code>
        <p>In this example, we have a token definition, <token>var:c:your name =&gt; [Name]</token>. We assigned this token defintion to an <em><strong>alias</strong></em>, <alias>[Name]</alias> so that, instead of writing the full token multiple times, we could use the alias as a placeholder, instead. This makes the template easier to read and allows you to update the casing and token name in one spot for multiple aliases.</p>
        <p>We could also have used aliases for our other two tokens too, but since they only appear once, there is less incentive to create an alias for them. It's up to you if you want to create aliases for all <strong>var</strong> tokens, but you don't have to.</p>
        <p>What are the key syntax rules for aliases?</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Not all token <em>types</em> can use aliases, but the "var" token type can use aliases.</li>
            <li>Define an alias with the symbol, <strong>=&gt;</strong> to the right of the token name</li>
            <li>In the previous example, brackets around the alias have <em>no significance</em> other than to make the alias more readable... brackets are NOT required. I could have used anything as my alias, like <alias>(Name)</alias> or <alias>nombre</alias> or event <alias>foO</alias>. Most anything after the <strong>=&gt;</strong> would work as an alias.</li>
            <li>Capitalization matters! If you have two aliases with different capitalization, then they are considered different aliases. Notice in the example I spelled <alias>Name</alias> with a capital first letter. I prefer to match the token's casing rule with the casing of the alias for readability; you may have two tokens with the same name but different casings. If you use this convention, it's easy to remember the casing applied to the token by looking at the casing of the alias.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another way to write the previous example template with aliases (based on personal preference) is as follows. This template will yield the same result, as the previous example, when creating projects. The difference is only in the way the tokens/aliases are written:</p>
		<code file="Using multiple aliases"><token>var:c:your name =&gt; [Name]</token>
		<token>var:l:favorite color =&gt; (color)</token>
        <token>var:n:adjective =&gt; |adj|</token>
        
        Hi <alias>[Name]</alias>,
        
        What's your favorite color?
        Oh, it's <alias>(color)</alias>?
        That's a very <alias>|adj|</alias> choice, <alias>[Name]</alias>!</code>
        <p>Using token aliases can help make your template cleaner and easier to read.</p>
        <h3>More than one template file</h3>
        <p>So far we've only created and used templates with one file. However, in the real world, projects usually contain multiple files. Let's add another file to our template, "VarTokenExamples" so we can study how tokens behave in templates with more than one file:</p>
		<code file="templates/VarTokenExamples/anotherfile.html"><token>var:c:your name =&gt; Name</token>
		<token>var:l:favorite color =&gt; colour</token>
        <token>var:n:adjective =&gt; -ad-</token>
        <token>var:n:disliked color =&gt; (color)</token>
        
        Hi again <alias>Name</alias>,
        
        So you want to see more examples?
        You told me your favorite color was <alias>colour</alias>.
        I still think that choice is <alias>-ad-</alias>. 
        Yay.
        My favorite color is <alias>(color)</alias>... oh you don't like it too? 
        
        Here's <htm>a href="examples.html"</htm>proof of our previous exchange<htm>/a</htm>.</code>
        <p>After I create this new template file, I will re-build my project:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="5" src="img/9_1.gif" alt="Build a project with multiple template files" />
        <p>Note the token aliases that were used between the two template files... </p>
        <P>This demonstration reveals some key details about the <strong><em>scope</em></strong> of token <em>aliases</em>, compared to token <em>names</em>, across multiple template files.</p> 
        <h3>Token scope / alias scope</h3>
        <p>The last demonstration used one template, "<strong>VarTokenExamples</strong>", that has two template files, "<strong>examples.html</strong>" and "<strong>anotherfile.html</strong>", to create a project. Both template files contain tokens and token aliases:</p>
        <p><strong>examples.html</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><token>var:c:your name =&gt; [Name]</token></li>
			<li><token>var:l:favorite color =&gt; (color)</token></li>
        	<li><token>var:n:adjective =&gt; |adj|</token></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>anotherfile.html</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><token>var:c:your name =&gt; Name</token></li> The "your name" token uses "Name" as its alias instead of "[Name]"... <u>the scope of an alias is limited to the file in which it is defined</u>; this file has no knowledge of the "[Name]" alias defined in "examples.html". Instead, this file uses "Name" as the alias for this token.
            <li><token>var:l:favorite color =&gt; colour</token></li>
            <li><token>var:n:adjective =&gt; -ad-</token></li>
            <li><token>var:n:disliked color =&gt; (color)</token> The "(color)" alias is used in both files... but for different token names. This is allowed because <u>the scope of an alias is limited to the file in which it is defined</u>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Token <em><strong>names</strong></em>, including "your name", will all represent the same value inside the template. However, token <em><strong>aliases</strong></em>, including "[Name]", will only represent the token name in the file in which the alias is defined. A single token name means the same thing in multiple token files... although a token alias only retains its meaning within a single file; if you want to use the same token alias in different files, then you must define the token alias again in each file.</p>
        <h3>Checkpoint -- What you learned:</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>If your templates folder contains an empty folder, then is this folder considered a template? What would you have to do to make your empty folder a listed Newfiles template?</li>
            <li>What are token "<strong>aliases</strong>" and how do they make templates easier to read / maintain?</li>
            <li>Will token names represent the same value when they are used in different template files?</li>
            <li>If you define a token alias in one file, will the token alias automatically represent the same token name in <em>ALL</em> of the template's files?</li>
            <li>Consider this token definition: <token>var:c:project name =&gt; [Project]</token>. If you use the <em>lowercase</em> token alias, <alias>[project]</alias> in the same file, will the alias represent the "project name" input value? Why not?</li>
        </ul>

    	<h2>Controlling project file names and folders</h2>
        <h3>Introducing the "filename" token-type</h3>
        <p>So far, all of our templates lack influence over the location or names of project files. In the real world, you may want to create projects that have different file/folder structure. This structure may change depending on the new project you want to create.</p> 
        <p>Similar to creating value-placeholders with <strong><em>var</em></strong> tokens, Newfiles lets you create placeholders for both filenames and folder paths with the <strong><em>filename</em></strong> token type:</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of the "<strong>filename</strong>" type's syntax:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><token>filename:l:"my-file-name"</token> changes the project file's name to lowercase "my-file-name".</li>
            <li><token>filename:u:my-file-name</token> asks you to enter a value for the project's file name in the command line. Whatever you enter will be transformed to uppercase.</li>
            <li><token>filename:n:.</token> keeps the file name the same as whatever it is inside the template.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those three filename examples only control a project's file name. What does the token look like if you want to change the file path? Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><token>filename:l:new/file/path:"my-file-name"</token> changes the project file's name to lowercase "my-file-name". <em>This file will be placed in a new path, "<strong>new/file/path</strong>", starting at the root of wherever you build your project</em>.</li>
            <li><token>filename:u:some/path:my-file-name</token> asks you to enter a value for the project's file name in the command line. Whatever you enter will be transformed to uppercase. <em>This file will be placed in a new path, "<strong>some/path</strong>", starting at the root of wherever you build your project</em>.</li>
            <li><token>filename:n:my-path:.</token> keeps the file name the same as whatever it is inside the template. <em>This file will be placed in a new folder, "<strong>my-path</strong>", at the root of wherever you build your project</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The parts of filename token types are as follows:</p>
		<ol>
        	<li><strong>Type</strong>: The first part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-type</em>. These examples, use the "<em>filename</em>" type.</li>
            <li><strong>File name casing</strong>: The second part of a token is <u>always</u> the <em>token-casing</em>. For example, <token>filename:u:some/path:my-file-name</token> uses UPPERCASE casing for the file's name, specified by the letter, "u".</li>
            <li><strong>File root folder path (optional)</strong>: The second-to-last part of a filename token is the <em>file path</em>. The file path is optional. If no path is written in the token, then the file will be placed directly in your project's root directory, by default. <token>filename:u:some/path:my-file-name</token> will put the file under the "some/path" directory. Whereas, <token>filename:u:my-file-name</token> will place the file in the project's root folder.</li>
            <li><strong>File name</strong>: The last part of a filename token is <u>always</u> the <em>file name</em>. Note, this part is always <em>last</em>, but it's not always <em>third</em> (ie: it will be the fourth part if the file path is specified).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Great. Now that you know the "filename" token-type syntax, let's try using this token type in a new template.</p>
        <h3>Using "filename" tokens in a template</h3>
        <p>First, I'll create a new template for demonstrating the use of "filename" tokens. This template will generate projects that follow standard web-site file structure conventions. I'll call the template <strong>"StandardWeb"</strong>. The template will be designed to generate the following project-file structure:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>index.html</strong> contains the markup-text for our simple web-site structure.</li>
            <li><strong>css/styles.css</strong> contains the style rules</li>
            <li><strong>js/script.js</strong> contains our custom javascript</li>
            <li><strong>js/jquery.min.js</strong> contains the popular (and useful) jQuery javascript library</li>
        </ul>
        <code file="templates/StandardWeb/index.html"><token>filename:l:[folder]:.</token>
        	<token>var:n:project folder =&gt; [folder]</token>
        	<token>var:c:project name =&gt; [Project]</token>
        
        	<htm>html</htm>
            <htm>head</htm>
            <htm>title</htm><alias>[Project]</alias><htm>/title</htm>
            <htm>link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" /</htm>
            <htm>script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.min.js"</htm><htm>/script</htm>
			<htm>script type="text/javascript" src="js/script.js"</htm><htm>/script</htm>
            <htm>/head</htm>
            <htm>body</htm>
            <htm>h1 class="main-title"</htm><alias>[Project]</alias><htm>/h1</htm>
            <htm>!-- your content here --</htm>
            <htm>/body</htm>         
        <htm>/html</htm></code>
        <p><strong>index.html</strong> contains some pretty standard HTML; it contains a link to a stylesheet; jQuery is linked to the page; there is a custom script file too; There is an <htm>h1</htm> title tag; finally, there is a page <htm>title</htm> (this title appears in the browser tab).</p>
        <p>We are also using 3 tokens within <strong>index.html</strong> in order to identify unique project values:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><token>filename:l:[folder]:.</token> The dot, '.' tells Newfiles to use <strong>index.html</strong> as the project-file's name (keep it the same). the letter 'l' tells Newfiles to make sure the filename is always lowercase. The <alias>[folder]</alias> alias is used as the parent folder for the <strong>index.html</strong> project-file so whatever you input for the "project folder" will be used as the parent folder name.</li>
            <li><token>var:n:project folder =&gt; [folder]</token> This token's only purpose is to define the project's root folder name. The <alias>[folder]</alias> alias is used in defining the first folder name in the filename path.</li>
            <li><token>var:c:project name =&gt; [Project]</token> This token defines the name of the project. The <alias>[Project]</alias> is used to define some variable content values in the file.</li>
        </ul>
        <code file="templates/StandardWeb/styles.css"><token>filename:l:[folder]/css:.</token>
        <token>var:n:project folder =&gt; [folder]</token>
        
        body{font-size:1em;}
        .main-title{font-size:180%;color:#0C396C;}</code>
        <p><token>filename:l:[folder]/css:.</token> tells newfiles to place this project file in the path, "<alias>[folder]</alias>/css". The file name will always be lowercase. A dot, '.' is used to tell Newfiles to keep the project-file the same name as the template file so, in this case, the project file will always be <strong>styles.css</strong>.</p>
        <code file="templates/StandardWeb/script.js"><token>filename:l:[folder]/js:.</token>
        <token>var:n:project folder =&gt; [folder]</token>
        
        jQuery(document).ready(function(){
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*your document-ready code here*/
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//window-ready happens AFTER document-ready
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jQuery(window).ready(function(){
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/*your window-ready code here*/
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
        });</code>
        <p><token>filename:l:[folder]/js:.</token> tells newfiles to place this project file in the path, "<alias>[folder]</alias>/js". The file name will always be lowercase. A dot, '.' is used to tell Newfiles to keep the project-file the same name as the template file so, in this case, the project file will always be <strong>script.js</strong>.</p>
        <code file="templates/StandardWeb/jquery.min.js"><token>filename:l:[folder]/js:.</token>
        <token>var:n:project folder =&gt; [folder]</token>
        
        /*! jQuery v2.1.1 | (c) 2005, 2014 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license */
        !function(a,b){"object"==typeof module&amp;&amp;"object"==typeof module.exports...
        
        ... copy the full code from the <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js" target="_blank">jQuery Google Hosted Library</a> ...
        </code>
        <p><token>filename:l:[folder]/js:.</token> tells newfiles to place this project file in the path, "<alias>[folder]</alias>/js". The file name will always be lowercase. A dot, '.' is used to tell Newfiles to keep the project-file the same name as the template file so, in this case, the project file will always be <strong>jquery.min.js</strong>.</p>
        <p>The full code for jquery.min.js is NOT shown. If you want to copy the full code, you can click on the jQuery Google Hosted Library link in the example.</p>
        <p>Go ahead and finish creating this new "StandardWeb" template, if you haven't already done so. Remember, a quick way to open your templates folder, is to type <cmd>nf templates</cmd> in your command line console. After you create the "StandardWeb" template, we'll build a test project from this template to demonstrate the filename token's ability to define file names and paths:</p>
        <img slide="true" slides="6" src="img/10_1.gif" alt="Demo the filename token type" />
        <p>Notice the resulting folder structure for the project that was created: I used the filename token type to position each of my files exactly where they should go within my project. With Newfiles, you have precise control over the structure of your boiler-plate projects.</p>
        <h3>Demo two methods to change project file names</h3>
        <p>The previous "StandardWeb" template only used one of the three methods for controlling file names; each template file kept the same name when the project was created. For example, in index.html, <token>filename:l:[folder]:.</token> The dot, '.' tells Newfiles to use <strong>index.html</strong> as the project-file's name (keep it the same).</p>
        <p>However, you do NOT always have to use the template file name as the project file name; there are two different ways to <em>change</em> the project file names, which weren't yet demonstrated:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>String literal</strong>. You can write the file name into the filename token. To do this, just surround the file name in quotes. The quotes make sure Newfiles views the written text as a <em>string literal</em>.
            	<ul>
                	<li>Token example: <token>filename:n:some/path:"my-file-name"</token></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User input</strong>. You can set the file name by entering into the command line console when you are building a project. If you do NOT use quotes, then Newfiles will ask you to input a file name value instead of treating the name as a string literal, eg: <cmd>Enter --&gt; "my-file-name" &gt;&gt; </cmd>.
            	<ul>
                	<li>Token example: <token>filename:n:some/path:my-file-name</token></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        	<li><strong>Dot</strong>. This method was already demonstrated. A dot will tell Newfiles to keep the file name the same.
            	<ul>
                	<li>Token example: <token>filename:n:some/path:.</token></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
