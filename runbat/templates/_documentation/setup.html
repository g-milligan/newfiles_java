    	<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Forget what you think you know... if you think the installation process is difficult. As long as you follow the detailed steps, you should be successful. If you're like me, you may feel apprehensive, when getting to know new software (having been burned in the past by poor documentation and sub-par applications). But having been exposed to such half-assed slop, I feel incentive to produce quality stuff.</p>
        <p>My aim is quality and simplicity. Period. If we mean to accomplish great things, then first we must learn to jump the small hurdles. So let's start...</p>

        <h2>1. Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is designed to work on both <strong><u>Windows</u></strong> and <strong><u>Mac</u></strong> computers. Have one of these? You're good to go.</p>
        <p><strong>A note to Linux users</strong>: You may still be able to look at these setup instructions and figure out how to get it running. But, I've never personally tried Newfiles on Linux.</p>

        <h2>2. Required JDK Version</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is programmed in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html" target="_blank">Java</a> and requires a minimum Java Development Kit (JDK) version. You can download the JDK for free from the internet (of course).</p>
        <p>The <em>minimum</em> requirement is <strong>JDK <u>1.7.0_17</u></strong>.</p>
        <p>If you already have this, or a later version, you can skip to step 3. Otherwise, you will have to download a JDK version that will meet this minimum requirement.</p>

        <h2>3. Download Newfiles's Files</h2>
        <p>There are two ways to download Newfiles's files...</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>Via GIT repository <em>(if you already know, love, and use GIT)</em></li>
            <li>Go to the online repository and manually download the files <em>(the easy... beginner way)</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you choose to learn <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</a>, it will make it easier to get newer copies whenever Newfiles is updated.</p>
        <p>Knowing GIT is an essential skill to any type of project that requires code management. Code management is pretty important, man. I highly recommend learning how to use GIT, if you don't already. But I won't force you to use GIT. The choice is yours; I can't stop you from making poor decisions. But anyway, let's continue...</p>
