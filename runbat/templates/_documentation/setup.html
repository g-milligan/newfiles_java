    	<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Forget what you think you know... if you think the installation process is difficult. As long as you follow the detailed steps, you should be successful. If you're like me, you may feel apprehensive, when getting to know new software (having been burned in the past by poor documentation and sub-par applications). But having been exposed to such half-assed slop, I feel incentive to produce quality stuff.</p>
        <p>My aim is quality and simplicity. Period. If we mean to accomplish great things, then first we must learn to jump the small hurdles. So let's start...</p>
    </section>

        <h2>1. Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is designed to work on both <strong><u>Windows</u></strong> and <strong><u>Mac</u></strong> computers. Have one of these? You're good to go.</p>
        <p><strong>A note to Linux users</strong>: I've never personally tried Newfiles on Linux, but I'm sure if you are a Linux user, you'll probably have the skills to get this simple Java program running.</p>
        <a name="jdk"></a>
        <h2>2. Required JDK Version</h2>
        <p>Newfiles is programmed in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html" target="_blank">Java</a> and requires a minimum Java Development Kit (JDK) version. You can download the JDK for free from the internet (of course).</p>
        <p>The <em>minimum</em> requirement is <strong>JDK <u>1.7.0_17</u></strong>.</p>
        <p>If you already have this, or a later version, you can skip to step 3. Otherwise, you will have to download a JDK version that will meet this minimum requirement.</p>
        <a name="jdk-check"></a>
        <h3>How to check your JDK version</h3>
        <div class="os">
        	<div name="win">
            	<p>Open up a command prompt. In <em>Windows</em>, you would type <cmd>cmd</cmd> into the start menu, for example. This would cause the cmd.exe program to open up your command prompt window. If you don't know how to open the command prompt, you can <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+do+I+open+a+windows+command+prompt%3F" target="_blank">search for directions online</a>.</p>
                <p>Once the command prompt is open, type the following: <cmd>java -version</cmd>. This asks your computer what version of Java (if any) it has:</p>
                <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/setup/win/1_1.gif" alt="Checking installed JDK version" />
            </div>
        	<div name="mac">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see my console told me I have <cmd>java version "1.7.0_17"</cmd>. Yay! I meet the minimum requirements so I can move on to step 3 instead of having to download the required minimum version. If you aren't as lucky, just follow the next steps to get the SDK.</p>
        <a name="jdk-download"></a>
        <h3>How to download the minimum JDK version</h3>
        <p>You can find <em>additional instructions</em>, published by Oracle, for installing the SDK:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><em>(optional)</em> <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html" target="_blank">Java SDK Installation instructions (Windows)</a></li>
            <li><em>(optional)</em> <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/mac/mac-jdk.html" target="_blank">Java SDK Installation instructions (Mac)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Download</h4>
        <p>Download the JDK from Oracle's website <em>(Oracle currently owns the Java platform, which is free to download)</em>.</p>
        <ul><li>Click here to access the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download page for the Java SDK</a></li></ul>
        <img slide="true" slides="2" src="img/setup/1_1.gif" alt="Download the Java SDK" />
        <p>Should you choose the <em>32 or 64 bit version</em>? Make sure you choose the one that matches the type of computer you are using. It's important to download the correct SDK version. Note: <em>x86</em> is for <em>32-bit systems</em>.</p>
        <h4>Install</h4>
        <p>After you download the SDK, you will need to walk through the <strong>installation process</strong> on your computer.</p>
            <p>Here are screenshots for the installation process <em>(I like to visually confirm that I'm on the right track when I'm following a walk through, so I've afforded you this opportunity)</em>...</p>
    <p>Don't worry if your installation isn't <em>exactly</em> the same as mine. These screenshots are only a <em>rough guide</em> to help you know you're on the right track:</p>
        <div class="os">
        	<div name="win">
            	<p>Installation on <u>64-bit Windows</u> <em>(as it was at the time of this writing)</em>... it's still cool if you have a 32-bit (x86) system instead:</p>
            	<img slide="true" slides="7" src="img/setup/win/2_1.gif" alt="Install the Java SDK" />
            </div>
        	<div name="mac">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Once you've finished the installation, <a href="#jdk-check">check your Java SDK version again</a>... if you see a working Java version then congratulations! Time to move to the next step.</p>
        <p>However, if you still don't see the minimum version appear when you use <cmd>java -version</cmd>, then something's wrong and you need to fix it before you can proceed <em>(Refer back to Oracle's installation instructions... that link was <a href="#jdk-download">provided earlier</a>)</em>.</p>
        <p>Side note: <em>If you are interested in learning more about the Java language, there is a decent amount of information written on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java language's Wikipedia page</a></em>.</p>
        <a name="newfiles-download"></a>
        <h2>3. Download Newfiles's Files</h2>
        <p>There are two ways to download Newfiles's files...</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>Via Git repository <em>(if you already know, love, and use Git)</em></li>
            <li>Go to the online repository and manually download the files <em>(the easy... beginner way)</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you choose to learn <a target="_blank" href="http://Git-scm.com/">Git</a>, it will make it easier to get newer copies whenever Newfiles is updated.</p>
        <p>Knowing Git is an essential skill to any type of project that requires code management. Code management is pretty important, man. I highly recommend learning how to use Git, if you don't already. But I won't force you to use Git. The choice is yours; I can't stop you from making poor decisions. But anyway, let's continue...</p>
        <a name="newfiles-download-Git"></a>
        <h3>Use Git to download Newfiles <em>(for the pro's)</em></h3>
        <h4>New to Git?</h4>
        <p><em><strong>What is Git?</strong></em> It's an application that lets you type console commands, like <cmd>git pull origin master</cmd> or <cmd>git push origin master</cmd> in order to <em>move files between your computer and external computers</em>. Websites like <a target="_blank" href="https://Github.com/">Github.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket.org</a> host a backup of the files that you push to their servers. Any location that holds your files is called a <strong>repository</strong>. So... let's say you take a baseball bat to your computer. Your files are still safe on the external repository. When you get a new computer you can just <cmd>git pull origin master</cmd> from the external repository to get a copy of your files onto your new local machine.</p>
        <p>The <em>real</em> power of Git, however, comes from its ability to manage and merge file changes coming from more than one developer. For example, if you and your friend are developing a sweet game mod at the same time; editing the same files at the same time. When you <cmd>git push origin develop</cmd> Git will detect the conflict and help you decide how to merge the conflicting files. Or Git may be able to automatically merge edits from both you and your buddy.</p>
        <p>Right now, you don't have to know about these details... although it wouldn't hurt for you to <a target="_blank" href="http://Git-scm.com/doc">read more about Git</a> when you have time; knowing about Git is probably useful for you, considering you are here learning about Newfiles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>What do I do now? Git to the point:</strong></em></p>
        <div class="os">
        	<div name="win">
            	<p>On Windows, you can run Git commands in a special console application called <strong>GitBash</strong>. You <em>cannot</em> just run Git commands in the normal <strong>cmd</strong> prompt. But downloading GitBash is quick, easy and free to install.</p>
                <p>You can find the download link on the Git website or just click the link here: <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">GitBash download (starts immediately on click)</a>.</p>
                <p>Walk through the installation process. When you are done, you should be able to open the application and write <cmd>git version</cmd> to see a response:</p>
                <img slide="true" slides="1" src="img/setup/win/3_1.gif" alt="GitBash!" />
                <p>It's ok if you don't have the same version of Git <em>(since your version is from the future while I'm currently typing this in the past)</em>... as long as you see any version at all.</p>
            </div>
        	<div name="mac">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Now that you <em>"know"</em> Git, proceed to the next step proudly.</p>
        <h4>Know Git already?</h4>
