  <<filename:uppercase:example output filename>>  Hi, <<var:capitalize:your name>> 

  ... so... you say your favorite color is <<var:uppercase:your favorite color>>? 
  Are you trying to be a <<var:lowercase:a random qualitative adjective>> person? 
  Despite this... I guess I will forgive you. 

  Anyway, you may have guessed by now that this template generator has the ability to insert 'madlib' tokens into your files.
  You can insert these tokens into your template file(s) and then define their values when it comes time to generate a template.

  Here are some token examples (you may recognize them):.
  =============================

  \<<var:capitalize:your name\>> 
  \<<var:uppercase:your favorite color\>> 
  \<<var:lowercase:a random adjective\>> 

  Note, 'var' is NOT the only type of token you can put into a template file...  
  You can also define a template file's name or folder path within your project's directory. With...  

  \<<filename:lowercase:file name\>> (you will be asked to enter the file name before the file is created from the template) 
  \<<filename:lowercase:sub/path:file name\>> (your file will be placed in a 'sub/path' directory under your project root directory) 
  \<<filename:lowercase:sub/path:.\>> (your file will be placed in a 'sub/path' directory, but it's template file name will remain the same) 

  I hope this helps. Peace out.
