Newfiles is a command-line tool to help build new projects from existing templates, instead of from scratch.

You can create templates for virtually any type of project. 
Newfiles is completely platform agnostic; it's not geared towards any one type of code Nor any one type of platform. 
You are only limited by your imagination, when it comes to creating templates.
